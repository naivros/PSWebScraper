PowerSchoolScraper


Using Selenium web driver I was able to autonomously, and safely extract the class data for each class from PowerSchool. After this function completed it would export these tables to x amount of excel files containing the grades of each class respective to the date, and any other information needed (practice / quiz / test).


While this didn't draw expected trendlines, it was straight-forward enough that a student could then draw trendlines, while this doesn't seem important, being a Senior in high school, it was great to be able to analyze whether your grade in Calculus need more attention than in English, I was able to completely prioritize my life, and end up working a 30 hour job for most of my Senior year, while still having time for friends.


This project was done one night after school, when I was staring blankly at PowerSchool, just waiting for a solid indicator or trendline to jump out into my face, and help me decide whether AP Calc BC or DE English 12 was more important. Regardless, it was my first experience with a webscraper, ended up using Selenium 'Web Driver', and had a lot of fun with BeautifulSoup4. I believe this was one of my first serious attempts at using Python, and I ended up using Node.JS, as my safe language for Express.js' web engine, by copying most of index.js from my Calculus Project.
